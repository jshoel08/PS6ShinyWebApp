# PS6ShinyWebApp

This Shiny App reads in one of the Data Set's from me and my groups project that we are working on.

The data is about the relationship between Students and Alcohol consumption. Taking in a plethora of variables from their age, parents jobs/backgrounds, living conditions, students grades, weekday and weekend alcohol consumption and much more. However, my pages and my variables zoom more towards the relationship between alcohol consumption and parentsâ€™ cohabitation status.

With this, here is the short descriptions of the variables (these descriptions were taken/paraphrased from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption):

school - student's school ('GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)

sex - student's sex (F - female or M - male)

age - age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)

address - address - student's home address type (U - urban or R - rural)

Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (T - living together or A - apart)

Dalc - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)

Walc - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)

These variables/grades below are related with the course subject. In this case math.

G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)

G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)

G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)
